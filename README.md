# Project1
In this assignment, I implement an odd-even transposition sort by 
using MPI program. The odd-even transposition sort is a kind of sort method which is 
used to order a list of elements. In this project, the elements in the list which needs to 
be sorted will be allocated to n processes (n is the number of processes, if n=1, the
program is a sequential program and if n is more than 1, the program is a parallel 
program). We will use all kinds of random arrays to test our programs and compare 
the effect of all kinds of factors like parallel or sequential, the number of nodes, the 
number of processes and so on.
# Project2
In this assignment, I implement a Mandelbrot Set Computation by 
using MPI and Pthread program. The Mandelbrot Set Computation is a method used 
to identify whether the points in a figure to satisfy the conditions in the method or not.
The method has its own calculating iterations to justify all the points in the figure. If 
the points satisfy the conditions, we will draw it as a black point in the final figure. In 
this project, all the points in the figure will be allocated to n processes (n is the 
number of processes, if n=1, the program is a sequential program and if n is more than 
1, the program is a parallel program) or n threads (n is the number of threads, if n=1, 
the program is a sequential program and if n is more than 1, the program is a parallel 
program). We will use all kinds of figures in different sizes to test our programs and 
compare the effect of all kinds of factors like parallel or sequential, using MPI or 
using Pthread, the sizes of the figures and so on.
# Project3
In this assignment, I implement a N-body System by using MPI, 
sequential, openmp, MPI+openmp, CUDA and Pthread program. The N-body System 
is a system that simulate the real body system. The system has its own calculating 
iterations to change the state of all the bodies like the velocity, position and force. We 
will make all the bodies shown in a image and change with iterations. In this project, 
all the points in the figure will be allocated to n processes (n is the number of 
processes, if n=1, the program is a sequential program and if n is more than 1, the 
program is a parallel program) or n threads (n is the number of threads, if n=1, the 
program is a sequential program and if n is more than 1, the program is a parallel 
program). We will use all kinds of figures in different number of bodies to test our 
programs and compare the effect of all kinds of factors like parallel or sequential, 
using MPI or using Pthread or using openmp or using MPI+openmp or using CUDA, 
the number of bodies in the figures and so on.
# Project4
In this assignment, I implement a Heat System by using MPI, 
sequential, openmp, MPI+openmp, CUDA and Pthread program. The Heat System is 
a system that simulate the real heat system in a room. The system has its own fire 
source whose temperature is very high and other places where are relatively cold. The 
heat will be spread from the fire source to other places by Jacobi Iteration. In this 
project, all the points in the map will be allocated to n processes (n is the number of 
processes, if n=1, the program is a sequential program and if n is more than 1, the 
program is a parallel program) or n threads (n is the number of threads, if n=1, the 
program is a sequential program and if n is more than 1, the program is a parallel 
program). We will use all kinds of maps in different number of processes to test our 
programs and compare the effect of all kinds of factors like parallel or sequential, 
using MPI or using Pthread or using openmp or using MPI+openmp or using CUDA, 
the number of bodies in the maps and so on.
